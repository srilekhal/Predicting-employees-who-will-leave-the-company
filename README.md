Built a predictive model which can flag good employees who are likely to leave the company using attributes like tenure, age, department, salary, performance rating, etc. Performed data preprocessing steps which included missing value imputation using the median, Linear Discriminant Analysis, Linear Regression, outlier imputation, binning continuous variables, one hot encoding, resampling of the unbalanced dataset among others. The best predictive model - Random Forest Classifier predicted the employee churn with 4.6% misclassification rate and AUC score of 0.95 on the validation dataset.
